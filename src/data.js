        about:`STRAP SIZE FOR MEN'S WATCHES
        The straps of most dress watches and sports watches are prong-and-notch, which allows for easy adjusting. Some metal watch bands are composed of links, which can be added or removed.
        
        A strap width refers to the distance between the lugs (holes) where the strap meets the watch. Generally speaking, a men's watch strap should correspond with the distance between the inside of the lugs on the watch head.
        
        The length of the strap depends on your wrist size and includes two measurements – the tail end (length of the long section) and the buckle end (length of the short section, excluding the buckle).
        
        Length is expressed in millimeters, for example – 120/70 mm.
        
        Here’s a standard guide to choosing a strap length to fit your wrist:
        
        6.0 - 6.5” wrist (150 - 164 mm) = 120/70 mm strap
        6.6 - 7.0” wrist (165 - 178 mm) = 125/75 mm strap
        7.1 - 7.5” wrist (179 - 190 mm) = 130/80 mm strap
        7.6 - 8.0” wrist (191 - 203 mm) = 135/80 mm strap
        8.1 - 8.5” wrist (204 - 216 mm) = 140/85 mm strap
        8.6 - 9.0” wrist (217 - 229 mm) = 145/90 mm strap
        CASE SIZE FOR MEN'S WATCHES
        Now, while an oversized dial that bulges out of your sleeve is awkward and unattractive, a super-small case only makes it difficult to read the time (it’ll also make your wrist look enormous).
        
        The case for a men's watch should be proportionate to your build – not too bulky and not too delicate.
        
        For most guys, the general rule of thumb for a watch case is between 34 mm - 50 mm (1 5/16" - 2") in diameter (measuring across the watch face from one side to the other). If you have a particularly thin or narrow wrist, you’ll want something smaller than 40 mm (1 9/16"). Anything bigger than 50 mm (2") is quite the statement-making piece.
        
        MEN'S WATCH CASE THICKNESS
        As a general rule, the thickness of the watch case is directly proportional to the diameter. That is, the wider the diameter, the thicker the case.
        
        The thickness of a men's watch case has a lot to do with its design – particularly the type of movement. Mechanical watches need a lot more space for the gears and wheels. The number of complications also has an impact on the size... as does the overall style of the watch.
        
        It’s a good idea to choose a watch case that aligns with your shape and size.
        
        Consider the size of your arm, and what you want to wear the watch with. A watch that you’ll wear with a suit should be slim enough to slide underneath your cuff..`,
